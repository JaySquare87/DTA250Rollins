# Homework 4. V2

# Question 1 ----
# Write a function named `area_triangle` that calculates the area of a triangle.
# The function should take two arguments, `base` and `height`, and return the area
# calculated using the formula 
# 0.5 × base × height
# Once the function is defined, use it to compute the area of a triangle
# with a base of 5 and a height of 7, and another with a base of 10 and a height of 15.

area_triangle <- #Your code here

# Test the function
area57 <- #Your code here
area1015 <- #Your code here

# Question 2 ----
# Write a function called even_or_odd that takes a number as an argument
# and will print "<number> is even" is the number is even. else, it will print
# "<number> is odd"
# Use the sprintf() function to format the output.
# Test your function on the following numbers 5, 8.

even_or_odd <- #Your code here
  
# Test the function
evenodd5 <- #Your code here
evenodd8 <- #Your code here

# Question 3 ----
# Write a function named celsius_to_fahrenheit that converts temperature from 
# Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# The function should take a single argument, celsius, and return the 
# temperature in Fahrenheit,
# calculated using the formula
# (celsius × 9/5) + 32
# Once the function is defined, use it to convert the temperature from 
# Celsius to Fahrenheit for a temperature of 40°C, 25°C and -5°C.
# Inside the function, create an if statement to check if the temperature 
# calculated is greater than 90. If it is, return "It's hot!" 
# else, return "It's not hot!"

celsius_to_fahrenheit <- #Your code here

# Test the function
celsius40 <- #Your code here
celsius25 <- #Your code here
celsius5 <- #Your code here
