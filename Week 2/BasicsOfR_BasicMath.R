# Basics of R ----
# In this chapter we will learn about R's mathematical capabilities, variables,
# functions, and data types

## Basic Math ----

# TODO 
# Type 1 + 1 below and run your code either using the 'Run' button above


# TODO
# Now try 3 * 7 * 2


# TODO
# How about 4/2


# TODO
# Or maybe... (4 * 6) + 5


# TODO
# No wait... 4 * (6 + 5)


# TODO
# Is the answer for (4 * 6) + 5 the same for 4 * (6 + 5)? Write your answer as 
# a comment


## Variables ----
# In the R programming language, a variable is a symbol or name that stands for
# a value and is used to store data.

### Variable Assignment ----

# TODO
# Assign the value 2 to the variable x using the <- assignment operator


# TODO
# Assign the value 5 to the variable y using the <- assignment operator


# TODO
# Assign the value 3 to the variable z using the -> assignment operator


# TODO
# Assign the value 7 to the variables a and b using the <- assignment operator
# You can only write 7 once


# TODO
# Assign the value 4 to the variable j using the assign() function


# Variable names in R can be a combination of letters, numbers, periods, and 
# underscores. However, they must start with a letter or a period. If they start
# with a period, the second character cannot be a number. Also, R is 
# case-sensitive, so a variable named 'My_Variable' is different from 
# 'my_variable'.

# TODO
# is .jj a good variable name?
# is .2j a good variable name?
# is 2j a good variable name?
# is _2j a good variable name?
# is j2 a good variable name?
# is j.2 a good variable name?

### Removing Variables ----

# TODO
# Remove the variable j using the rm() function


# Why would you want to remove a variable in R?
# 1. Free Up Memory: Variables in R take up memory. If you're working with large
#   data sets or complex functions, your program could use a lot of memory, and 
#   this can slow down your computer or even cause it to run out of memory. 
#   By removing variables that you no longer need, you can free up memory and 
#   help your program run faster and more efficiently.
# 2. Data Management: In a complex script, you might create a lot of temporary 
#   variables that are used for intermediate steps. These variables can clutter 
#   your work space, making it harder to understand what's going on in your 
#   program. By removing these temporary variables when you're done with them, 
#   you can keep your work space clean and easy to understand.
# 3. Avoid Errors: If you have a variable in your work space from previous 
#   operations, it might interfere with your current operations, particularly if
#   you're reusing variable names. Removing variables when you're done with them
#   can help avoid this kind of error.
