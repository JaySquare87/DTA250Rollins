# Basics of R ----
# In this chapter we will learn about R's mathematical capabilities, variables,
# functions, and data types

## Vectors ----
# A vector is a collection of elements, all of the same type.
# A vector cannot be of mixed type.
# vectors play a crucial, and helpful, role in R. More than being a simple 
# containers, vectors in R are special in that R is a vectorized language.
# That means operations are applied to each element of the vector automatically,
# without the need to loop through the vector.
# Vectors don't have dimensions.
# No such thing as row vector or column vector

# The most common way to create a vector is using the c() function
# (remember me)
# The "c" stands for combine because multiple elements are being combined into a
# vector
# Let us start

#TODO
# create a vector of the numbers from 1 to 10 using the c() function


### Vector Operations ----

#TODO
# Multiply x by 3


#TODO
# Add 2 to x


#TODO
# subtract 3 from x


#TODO
# Divide x by 4


#TODO
# Raise x to the power of 2


#TODO
# Find the square root of x using the sqrt() function
