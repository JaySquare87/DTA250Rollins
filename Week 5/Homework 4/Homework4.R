# DTA250 - Fall 2023
# Homework 4
# I refuse to change my name. I will keep writing JJ.

# Question 1 ----
# Write a function named area_circle that calculates the area of a circle. 
# The function should take a single argument, radius, and return the area 
# calculated using the formula 
# π × radius^2
# Once the function is defined, use it to compute the area of a circle
# with radius 5 and another with radius 10.
# Print the results of your calculations to the console.


# Question 2 ----
# Write a function called even_or_odd that takes a number as an argument
# and will print "<number> is even" is the number is even. else, it will print
# "<number> is odd"


# Question 3 ----
# Write a function named temperature_feedback that provides feedback on the 
# weather based on the temperature value passed to it.
# If the temperature is below 0, it should return "It's freezing cold!"
# If the temperature is greater than 0 and less than or equal 15, it should 
# return "It's quite chilly."
# If the temperature is greater than 15 and less than or equal 30, it should 
# return "The weather is pleasant."
# If the temperature is above 30, it should return "It's scorching hot!"

# hint:
# utilize the & operator inside your if else statements
# Example
x <- 4
if (x >= 0 & x <= 5){
  print("x is less than 5 and greater than 0")
} else {
  print("x is greater than 5")
}
