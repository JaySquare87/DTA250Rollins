# Group Manipulation ----
# Another term for it is "data Munging"
# This often requires repeated operations on different sections of the data
# something Hadley Wickham coined “split-apply-combine.”

# They are used to make code more readable
# They are also used to make code more efficient

#TODO
# Load the library magrittr using the library() function
# This library contains the pipe operator %>%


#TODO
# Load the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 library using the data() function


#TODO
# Use the dim() function to get the dimensions of the first 4 rows of the 
# diamonds dataset (use the head() function to get the first 4 rows)


#TODO
# Use the %>% operator to get the dimensions of the first 4 rows of the
# diamonds dataset
